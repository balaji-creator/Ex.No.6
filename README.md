# Ex.No.6 Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools

# Date:
# Register no.
# Aim: Write and implement Python code that integrates with multiple AI tools to automate the task of interacting with APIs, comparing outputs, and generating actionable insights with Multiple AI Tools

#AI Tools Required:

# Explanation:
Aim:

To enable learners to design effective prompts for AI tools to assist in coding tasks related to their mini and final year projects.
Students will learn to request help from AI for:

Writing Python code

Integrating with multiple APIs

Comparing API outputs

Generating actionable insights based on results

Apparatus / Tools Required:

Computer or laptop with internet access

AI language model interface (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.)

Python programming environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, VS Code)

APIs for testing (e.g., Weather API, News API, Currency Conversion API)

Theory:

Prompt engineering is the practice of designing clear, structured instructions that guide AI systems to produce desired outputs.
Effective prompts in project coding help in:

Generating syntactically correct and functional code.

Ensuring multi-API integration works seamlessly.

Comparing outputs logically and highlighting significant differences.

Providing actionable insights or next steps based on the results.

Structured prompts improve AI performance and reduce ambiguity, making AI-assisted coding more efficient and reliable.
